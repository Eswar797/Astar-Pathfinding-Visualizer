# Astar Path Finding Visualizer
A Python program to implement and visualize A-star Path Finding Algorithm interactively.

## About the Algorithm 
A-star (also referred to as A*) is one of the most successful search algorithms to find the shortest path between nodes or graphs. It is an informed search algorithm, as it uses information about path cost and also uses heuristics to find the solution.

## Running The code
![A-star](https://github.com/saif191020/Astar-Pathfinding-Visualizer/blob/master/astar.gif)
* Click on the blocks to place the start point/end point/walls
* Press space to start the algorithm
* Press c to clear all blocks
* press left click to remove one block
* The algorithm can run in one of two modes with Visualizer and without Visualizer 
  * with Visualizer mode is the one seen above in gif
  * without Visualizer will find the path (blue line) without showing how it works and is almost instant
